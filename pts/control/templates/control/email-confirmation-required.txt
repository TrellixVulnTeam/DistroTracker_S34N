Hello,

some operations that you tried to execute on the {{ PTS_VENDOR_NAME }} Package
Tracking System require an e-mail confirmation. For reference, the
corresponding commands were:

{{ command_confirmation.commands }}
{% if confirmation_messages %}{% for confirmation_message in confirmation_messages %}
{{ confirmation_message }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

To complete this process and actually execute the corresponding operations, you
have to reply to this mail and include this command in your answer:
CONFIRM {{ command_confirmation.confirmation_key }}

On any modern mailer, you just have to hit reply and send the mail.

If you don't understand why you got this mail, please ignore it,
nothing will be done unless you send the confirmation.

If you have any problem with this service, please contact
{{ PTS_CONTACT_EMAIL }}.

Thanks,

--
