Hello,

you tried performing some commands in the {{ PTS_VENDOR_NAME }} Package Tracking
System which require confirmation. The commands are:

{{ command_confirmation.commands }}
{% if confirmation_messages %}{% for confirmation_message in confirmation_messages %}
{{ confirmation_message }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

To complete this process, you have to reply to this mail by including this
command:
CONFIRM {{ command_confirmation.confirmation_key }}

On any modern mailer, you just have to hit reply and send the mail.

If you don't understand why you got this mail, please ignore it,
you won't be unsubscribed unless you confirm it.

If you have any problem with this service, please contact
{{ PTS_CONTACT_EMAIL }}.

Thanks,

--
