Debian Package Tracking System
------------------------------

The Package Tracking System (PTS) has the following commands:

subscribe <srcpackage> [<email>]
  Subscribes <email> to all messages regarding <srcpackage>. If
  <email> is not given, it subscribes the From address. If the
  <srcpackage> is not a valid source package, you'll get a warning.
  If it's a valid binary package, the mapping will automatically be
  done for you.

unsubscribe <srcpackage> [<email>]
  Unsubscribes <email> from <srcpackage>. Like the subscribe command,
  it will use the From address if <email> is not given.

unsubscribeall [<email>]
  Cancel all subscriptions of <email>. Like the subscribe command,
  it will use the From address if <email> is not given.

which [<email>]
  Tells you which packages <email> is subscribed to.

keyword [<email>]
  Tells you the keywords that you are accepting. Each mail sent through
  the Package Tracking System is associated to a keyword and you receive
  only the mails associated to keywords that you are accepting. Here is
  the list of available keywords :
  * bts: mails coming from the Debian Bug Tracking System
  * bts-control: mails sent to control@bugs.debian.org
  * summary: automatic summary mails about the state of a package
  * cvs: notification of cvs commits
  * ddtp: notification of translations from the DDTP (cf ddtp.debian.org)
  * derivatives: notification of changes in derivative distributions
  * derivatives-bugs: bug traffic in derivative distributions
  * upload-source: announce of a new source upload that has been installed
  * upload-binary: announce of a new binary-only upload (porting)
  * katie-other: other mails from ftpmasters (override disparity, etc.)
  * contact: mails sent to the maintainer via <pkg>@packages.debian.org
  * buildd: notification of build failures on build daemons
  * default: all the other mails (those which aren't "automatic")
  By default you have the following keywords : bts, bts-control, summary,
  upload-source, katie-other, buildd, default.
  
keyword <srcpackage> [<email>]
  Same as previous item but for the given source package since
  you may select a different set of keywords for each source package.

keyword [<email>] {+|-|=} <list of keywords>
  Accept (+) or refuse (-) mails associated to the given keyword(s).
  Define the list (=) of accepted keywords.
  
keyword <srcpackage> [<email>] {+|-|=} <list of keywords>
  Same as previous item but overrides the keywords list for the indicated
  source package.
