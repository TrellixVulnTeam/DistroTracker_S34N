Notes concerning the package-tracking-system Debian package
-----------------------------------------------------------

The PTS "./manage.py" script (as usually provided by Django projects)
is available system wide as "pts-manage".

The package creates a dedicated "pts" system user that owns the
package specific directories in /var/lib/ and /var/cache/ and that
is used to run the various cron jobs that have to be run.
